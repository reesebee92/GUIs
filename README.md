# GUIs
The purpose of this project was to practice making GUIs using the Eclipse IDE and to use the Oracle JavaDoc Tutorials.

Design

The objective of this homework is to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a simple calculator. My plan is to start with understanding how to use Eclipse to create such an interface through reading the Oracle Java Document Tutorials. I also plan to use the drag and drop feature to create the visual portion of my model and scale in on the code portion to fine tune the actions. I need to create 3 Text Fields and 1 button. I also need to label all of my fields and button. 

After attempting to create my JFrame through the design portion, I realized that my computer is incompatible, thus I did everything manually through the code.
